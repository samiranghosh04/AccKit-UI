## Pre-Revenue and Pre-Code

Please note that AccKit UI is currently in the early stages of development, and no revenue model is in place. It is entirely free to use and open to contributions from the community.

As a pre-code project, development is underway, and no stable release is available yet. However, the project's repository will be made publicly accessible on GitHub once the initial codebase is ready for collaboration.
