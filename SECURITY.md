# AccKit UI Security Policy

At AccKit UI, we take security seriously and strive to ensure the safety and integrity of our open-source UI Component library. We welcome the community's support in identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities to us. This Security Policy outlines the steps to follow when handling any security-related issues within AccKit UI.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in AccKit UI, please follow these guidelines to responsibly report it:

1. **Privately Notify Us**: Please send an email to samiranghoshofficial04@gmail.com with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Avoid publicly disclosing the issue until it has been resolved by our team.

2. **Provide Essential Details**: In your report, include the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, the affected versions, and the potential impact.

3. **Be Responsive**: We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and work with you to understand the issue better.

4. **Coordination**: We kindly request that you give us reasonable time to address the problem before disclosing it to others.

## Patching Process

Our team will prioritize addressing security issues promptly. We'll keep you informed of our progress and, once a fix is ready, we'll coordinate with you regarding public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

As we are in the initial design and pre-code stage, AccKit UI is still under development. Our security efforts primarily focus on the latest development version.

## Keeping Dependencies Updated

AccKit UI relies on various third-party dependencies. We strive to keep them up-to-date and maintain a healthy ecosystem. If you discover any security concerns related to our dependencies, please inform us, and we will address them promptly.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask all users to follow responsible disclosure practices. Please refrain from exploiting any security vulnerabilities or sharing them with others until we have had a chance to address them.

Thank you for your collaboration in making AccKit UI a more secure project. Together, we can build a safer open-source community.
